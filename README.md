## Astra — Discover African Fashion in VR Before It Exists IRL  
🌍 Hedera Africa Hackathon 2025 Submission

## 🧠 Summary

Astra is building the bridge between immersive virtual fashion and real-world manufacturing.  
We let designers publish digital fashion in virtual storefronts where shoppers can explore, try on, and order custom pieces — all before anything is produced.  

Our mission begins in Africa, connecting fashion designers to global buyers through a transparent, on-chain system. But the impact extends far beyond — the same model can help the entire fashion industry reduce waste, verify creators, and make production on-demand.  

Using **Hedera Smart Contracts** and **Hedera Token Service**, Astra enables milestone-based **USDC escrow payments**, NFT-based design ownership, and (in the future) **Guardian-verified sustainability credentials** for creators.

This model reimagines retail: one where discovery happens virtually, production happens only when needed, and every designer can reach the world.



## 🧩 Key Features

- 🛍️ **Virtual Try-On Storefronts:** Immersive 3D stores where shoppers try digital outfits on avatars  
- ✍🏾 **Tokenized Fashion IP:** Every design is an NFT with proof of originality and timestamp  
- 🤝 **Smart Escrow Contracts:** Payments in USDC are released to creators in milestones  
- 📏 **Custom Sizing:** Buyers submit measurements so each outfit is made-to-fit  
- 🌍 **Creator-to-Maker Matching:** Connects designers, verified makers, and global shoppers seamlessly  
- ♻️ **Sustainable by Design:** No item is produced until ordered, reducing overproduction waste  



## 💡 What We Built

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Virtual Storefront MVP` | Immersive VR store for browsing and trying on digital designs |
| `Smart Escrow System` | Hedera Smart Contracts that manage milestone-based USDC payouts |
| `NFT Minting` | Uses Hedera Token Service (HTS) to tokenize creator designs with proof of ownership |
| `Frontend Portal` | A chat-enabled interface for collaboration, order tracking, and escrow release |
| `Planned: Guardian Sustainability Framework` | A future carbon accounting methodology for digital fashion creators |



## 🔗 How We Used Hedera

1. **Hedera Smart Contracts 2.0 (USDC Escrow):**  
   - Escrow holds buyer funds in USDC and releases them to makers in three stages: order start, work proof, and final delivery.

2. **Hedera Token Service (NFTs):**  
   - Every digital design is minted as an NFT with creator attribution and timestamp to prevent plagiarism and fake products.

3. **Planned: Guardian Sustainability Layer:**  
   - We’re developing a methodology for verifying sustainable creation and carbon savings through digital-first fashion — creating a measurable impact registry for fashion brands.



## 🔍 Use Case

Fashion brands can mint digital designs using **Hedera Token Service (NFTs)** on Astra.

A buyer visits a **physical pop-up fashion store** equipped with **VR headsets**.  
Inside the headset, they enter a virtual African fashion world filled with designs from Lagos, Nairobi, and beyond.

They:
- Browse digital outfits in immersive 3D  
- Try them on using a virtual avatar  
- Add favorites to their wishlist  

After removing the headset, they receive a purchase link where they:
- Input measurements  
- Pay securely in **USDC via Hedera smart contract escrow**  
- Track the maker’s progress until final delivery  

The verified maker produces the outfit, and it’s shipped directly to their doorstep.  
This model bridges immersive exploration with physical delivery — reducing overproduction while empowering designers and verified makers.



## 🎯 Why It Matters

Fashion today is broken — over $500B of unsold stock goes to waste each year.  
Designers are forced to mass-produce before knowing demand.  
Consumers have no sustainable way to preview how something will look or fit.  

Astra fixes this by merging digital fashion, on-demand manufacturing, and blockchain verification into one ecosystem that can start small — with African fashion creators — and scale globally to transform how clothes are designed, sold, and made.
